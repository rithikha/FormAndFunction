				<h4 style="color:black;">How do natural disasters affect and perpetuate patterns of inequity within cities?
				</h4>

					<p style="text-align:center; color:black"> --------------</p>

				<p style="text-align:center; color:black"> <i>At the heart of resiliency is the ability to evolve. Just as evolution favours those species which are quickest to adapt to changing circumstances, cities too change in both form and function in response to disasters. While many of these changes are both obvious and perceivable, others are not always so and are often connected to larger, more complex issues of disparity within a city.

				Built on Lenape, Rockaway and Canarsie Indians lands, New York City is currently the most densely populated urban area in the United States. Today, the metropolitan area consists of 5 boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island. These neighbourhoods, each with distinct socio-economic characters, have been shaped to a large extent by a long history of racial and economic disparity, ultimately contributing to NYC current class dynamics (Bowser & Devadutt, 2019).
				<br>
				<br>
				New York has had formidable struggles with disasters, both natural and manmade. Among them are severe storms and consequently, flooding, blackouts, and loss to human life and property. In 2007, the largest tornado to strike the city was recorded, taking 18 lives and causing 264 million dollars in damages. Many residents experienced power outages and the many of the city’s low-lying regions experienced severe flooding. A few years later in 2012, Hurricane Sandy made landfall causing a storm surge of over 13 feet in Battery Park, closure of the New York Stock Exchange (the longest it had ever been closed since 1888), and over depriving 8 million people in 8 U.S. States electricity for days, and in some cases, weeks (McCrank, 2012; Henry & Ramirez-Marquez, 2016). The event ultimately called for changes in infrastructure, the economy, and politics in the face of the climate crisis.
				<br>
				<br>
				The goal of preserving the previous order or “baseline” of society are at the heart of most recovery efforts and common definitions of resiliency used by policy-makers and understood by the public do not go beyond the concept of the ability of a community to rebound after an extreme event to its prior condition or to a functional state. However, Canadian ecologist C.S. Holling proposed a new way of understanding resilience in his 1973 works, which almost 50 years later, is becoming more relevant than ever in disaster prone areas, which are also struggling with deep class divides. Holling extends the definition of resilience beyond adaptation and into the concept of transformation. Carl Folke, a trans-disciplinary environmental scientist with the Royal Swedish Academy of Scientists, captures this new way of thinking proposed by Holling in his paper, Resilience (2016), writing that, “adaptation refers to human actions that sustain development on current pathways, while transformation is about shifting development into other emergent pathways and even creating new ones". Much of New York’s infrastructure planning for future natural disasters is framed around this former concept, however in order to address the secondary effects of natural disasters, which disproportionately affect vulnerable communities, the latter is needed to provide affected residents with adequate pathways for upward mobility.
				<br>
				<br>
				Entering the keywords “New York building” into Google returns autofill results such as “too tall” or “too high” or “20 floors,” the latter being a cheeky reference to a recent court ordered beheading of a west-side skyscraper violating zoning laws. Another proposal, described by the Guardian as “etiolated beanpoles” or essentially, piled up capital, has only just been halted by lawmakers and activists. The plan was to build a skyscraper in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, an area close to New York’s Chinatown that is already experiencing heavy gentrification (Ngu, 2019). The project would have added three 1,000ft tall apartment towers into a neighbourhood of low-rise walk-ups. While the proposal contains an element of inclusivity through a set number of affordable units, these benefits are likely to be cancelled out many times over by the rise in housing prices such a project would bring to the area. The median price of a condo in the Lower Eastside has already shot up from $280,000 in 2000 to over $1.6 million in 2018, while the hispanic population fell from 27% to 23% and white and asian populations rose in the same time period (Furman Center, 2018). While one gentrifying force has been abetted, many others are still at work not only in the Lower Eastside but across the entire New York metropolitan area.
				<br>
				<br>
				From highways built through black neighbourhoods, lack of access to public transportation in communities most in need of it, to realtors using tactics such as <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbusting”> blockbusting</a> and <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_steering”> racial steering</a> to perpetuate patterns in neighbourhood segregation, the legacies of racism are still embedded in many urban renewal projects and policies across the United States (Halsey III, 2016; Budds, 2018). Though urban design has been used to create inequality, it can also be used to counter the concentration of privilege that is occurring in many cities such as New York today. These solutions involve taking a second look at current land use to create higher density housing development, more accessible mobility networks, and creating policies that encourage and support the mixing of classes and race (Budds, 2018). As such, it’s worth observing historical changes in the types of construction occurring over time in different land-use zones.

				While resilience has been at the forefront of NYC’s rebuilding and planning efforts after Hurricane Sandy, it is a process that has largely neglected its most vulnerable communities. As Leigh Graham, professor of public management at the City University of New York’s College of Criminal Justice, writes, “If you have a city that's inequitable, probably its resilience process is also going to be inequitable.”

				<br>
				<br>
				Through the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Rebuild by Design competition, the Resilient Infrastructure Fund was created in order to address the dire need for rebuilding and resiliency efforts (Spivack, Walker, & Rosenbeg, 2019). Though this fund aimed “to provide social and economic benefits to the State” (Rebuild By Design, n.d.), such benefits were not made equal to all. As seen in the Urbanization map, new, post- disaster infrastructure were primarily mixed residential & commercial, commercial & office building, multi-family residential buildings, single-family residential buildings, and transportation & utility. Interestingly, the majority of these new developments, particularly residential infrastructure, were built on Staten Island, Manhattan, North Brooklyn, and North Queens — predominantly white areas.
				<br>
				<br>
				Gentrification is a complex issue that is closely tied to inequality and at surface level, it may manifest as the revitalization of a neighbourhood. However, upon closer examination, this revitalization is usually accompanied by the displacement of the original residents, homogenization of neighbourhood demographics, increases in housing prices, and new amenities and services that are only accessible to higher-income residents (Zuk et al., 2015). Many urbanists, such as Jane Jacobs, believe that gentrification can be beneficial in small amounts. This "positive" gentrification, also known as internal gentrification or incumbent upgrading, helps kickstart an inclusive revitalization process. In comparison, "negative" or external gentrification is one that kills diversity and displaces marginalized communities (Jacobs, 1967). Analyzing this phenomenon in New York City displays troubling findings — all regions of the city are either at risk or currently experiencing stable exclusion and on-going displacement (Urban Displacement Project, 2020). Furthermore, displaced residents often have few options in terms of re-settlement, as surrounding regions are also undergoing the same exclusive phenomena (Public Affairs, UC Berkeley, 2019).
				<br>
				<br>
				From a socio-economic perspective, low-income entities across all scales — countries, cities, neighbourhoods and individuals are often the most affected by natural disasters in terms of initial destruction, as well as the aftermath (Mata-Lima et al., 2013). Prior to Sandy, private developers had already began constructing resilient condos and more affluent and proactive homeowners purchased flood insurance, all while neglecting public housing which became consequently more susceptible to disasters. The tragedy is that this neglect continued post-disaster. As buildings that were considered more economically-valuable were elevated (consequently re-distributing the flow of water to lower-lying communities) and funding was prioritized to go towards wealthier owners, the most marginalized communities, particularly the city’s Black and Hispanic communities, were excluded and suffered disproportionately from the disaster,(Erdos, 2018; Mata-Lima et al., 2013).
				<br>
				<br>
				A study by the Pew Research Centre (2012) found that residential segregation by income increased in 27 out 30 major metropolitan areas in the United States causing middle class and mixed income neighbourhoods to shrink by almost 10% over 30 years. With 41% of the lower-income households in the New York metropolitan area situated in a majority lower-income census tract, New York was found to have the third highest Residential Income Segregation Index (RISI) score (Pew Research Center, 2012).

				<br>
				In 2010, prior to the occurrence of Hurricane Sandy, there were several notable racial clusters throughout New York City. The boroughs of Staten Island and Manhattan were primarily White, whereas Queens and Brooklyn had large clusters of Black communities. The Bronx was heavily populated by the Latino community, and the Asian community was dispersed throughout the city, with some dominance in north east Queens. Central Queens experienced a mix of races between Census Tracts, resulting in a more diverse spatial pattern. Staten Island, Brooklyn, and Queens became the most vulnerable to the hurricane (Chun, 2015), and though the previously mentioned clusters were generally still prevalent in 2015, there were particular areas where the change, or lack thereof, were more significant.
				<br>
				<br>
				<img src="images/demographicsinsert.png" style="width:100%; height:100%;">
				<br>
				<br>
				Staten Island experienced an increase in housing market prices after the disaster (Chun, 2015). As (Chun, 2015) explains, the destruction of homes included the destruction of old or unstable properties. Due to a variety of rebuilding campaigns, funds, and support, the region was able to renovate and rebuild properties, making homes in the area better than before (Chun, 2015). This is also evident in the Urbanization map, which shows a significant increase in new single-family housing buildings in the area between 2010 to 2015.  As the number of affordable housing decreased, this resulted in a surge of housing prices (Chun, 2015), affordable to only the wealthy upper class - which was dominated by the White race. Thus, post-Hurricane Staten Island saw an increase in White race predominance, and a decreased prevalence of other races in the area in 2015 - yet another example of gentrification, as seen in (Urban Displacement Project, 2020) .
				<br>
				<br>
				However, this is not new. (Florida, 2019) Finds that hurricanes allow cities to become more susceptible to gentrification. The areas of Black race dominance have the least gentrification, modeling “racially-concentrated poverty” (Florida, 2019). This pattern is reflected in the two heavily Black populated regions in Brooklyn and Queens, which remained the most in-tact within the 5 year period. That being said, the Urbanization Map clearly indicates that very few, if any, rebuilding efforts were made in these areas. Therefore, this suggests that while wealthy White communities are given a second chance at better neighbourhoods, those of low income backgrounds and ethnic minorities are not given these opportunities, only adding to their hardship in the face of natural disasters. For example, as a consequence of natural disasters, Black populations, along with other low-income populations such as the Latino race, are extremely vulnerable to mental health issues (Lin, Lu, Justino, Dong, & Lauper, 2016, pp. 314-319). It was found that the Bronx, which is heavily populated by Latino and Black races, experienced the greatest rates of mental health emergency department visits during Hurricane Sandy (Lin, Lu, Justino, Dong, & Lauper, 2016, pp. 314-319). Therefore, these populations face challenges from all angles - whether it be neighbourhood rebuilding efforts or the health of their communities.
				<br>
				<br>
				Hurricane Sandy stands as an example of how a lack of equality in rebuilding efforts can shape and further ingrain existing socioeconomic trends within the landscape of a city. New York City, with its distinct racial clusters, has created a foundation wherein minority populations do not receive the same healthy neighbourhood and lifestyle opportunities as those of the White race, even in the face of a natural disaster. Perhaps, this could be due to the undercounting of minority populations, as stated in (Maantay & Maroko, 2009, p. 111-124), leading to inadequate “emergency management and disaster planning” for these communities (Maantay & Maroko, 2009, p. 111-124). These pose as disadvantages to these communities, and inhibit resiliency for the city as a whole. It is during events such as Hurricane Sandy that communities must evaluate how their neighbourhoods have changed over time, and why certain areas are better off than others - creating an informed viewpoint for better city planning.
