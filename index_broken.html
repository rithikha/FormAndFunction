								<h2>RESILIENCE</h2>
								<p>At the heart of resiliency is the ability to evolve. Just as evolution favours those species which are quickest to adapt to changing circumstances, cities too change in both form and function in response to disasters of various degrees and types. While many of these changes are both obvious and perceivable, others are not always so.

								<h2>NYC</h2>
								<p>Built on Lenape, Rockaway and Canarsie Indians lands, New York City is currently the most densely populated major city in the U.S and was originally composed of five separate boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island – which were amalgamated in 1989 into the current metropolitan area. NYC currently has one of the largest foreign-born populations in the world, though much of its history and policy has perpetuated racial and economic disparity.</p>

				New York has had formidable struggles with disasters, natural and manmade. Among them, severe storms, floods, winter storms, tropical storms, and blackouts. “Severe storms” is an umbrella term for weather hazards including thunder and lightning, heavy precipitation, hail, or strong winds. Coastal regions along the eastern United States are susceptible to Nor’Easters, a macroscale extra-tropical cyclone typically accompanied by heavy rain and known to cause flooding and hurricane force winds. High population regions with close proximity to coastlines, like Long Island and New York City, are most vulnerable. Of the 20 to 40 storms approaching the Big Apple annually, not all make landfall, but the ones that do cause significant damage. In 2007, a Nor’Easter claimed the lives of 18 people and caused 264 million dollars in damages. Many experienced power outages and all low-lying regions were flooded. When Hurricane Sandy made landfall in 2012, the storm surge rose over 13 feet in Battery Park. The New York Stock Exchange closed for two days, the longest it had ever been closed since weather closures in 1888. The event called for changes in infrastructure, economy, and even in politics in the face of climate crises. Efforts to preserve the order of society are part of an ultimate effort to normalize the instability that is associated with New York’s tumultuous history with natural disasters.  Based on its roots from C. S. Holling, resilience is the ability of a community to rebound after an extreme event to its prior condition or to a functional state. Undoubtedly, much of New York’s infrastructure planning for the wake of a natural disaster is framed around this concept. Thwarting the effects of disaster while sustaining as little change as possible is probably at the heart of many resilience frameworks, though “remaining” may also imply maintaining gentrification and class exploitation under its guise.

				Natural disasters often reveal flaws in city planning, especially with respect to social interactions and poverty [2]. From a socio-economic perspective, poor countries, cities, and communities are often left with the aftermath of a natural disaster[2]. This is even more apparent amongst vulnerable or minority populations [2], who also experience greater psychological stress [3].
				<br>
				<br>
				The Racial Predominance in New York City Over Time map attempts to visualize the socio-economic consequences of Hurricane Sandy through the lens of racial distribution change. With a particular focus on 2010 and 2015, it analyses the racial predominance (between White, Black, Latino, and Asian groups) in each census tract and how their distribution patterns changed over 5 years. For any given area, the predominant race is shown by its respective colour, and the strength of the predominance is indicated by the colour saturation.
				<br>
				<br>
				In 2010, prior to the occurrence of Hurricane Sandy, there were several notable racial clusters throughout New York City. The boroughs of Staten Island and Manhattan were primarily White, whereas Queens and Brooklyn were largely inhabited by Black communities. The Bronx was heavily populated by the Latino community, and the Asian community was dispersed throughout the city, with some dominance in north east Queens. Central Queens experiences a mix of races between Census Tracts, resulting in a more diverse spatial pattern.
				<br>
				<br>
				Staten Island, Brooklyn, and Queens became the most vulnerable to the hurricane [1], and though the previously mentioned clusters were generally still prevalent in 2015, there were particular areas where the change, or lack thereof, were more significant.
				<br>
				<br>

				<br>
				Staten Island experienced an increase in housing market prices after the disaster [1]. As [1] explains, the destruction of homes included the destruction of old or unstable properties. Due to a variety of public and private rebuilding campaigns, the region was given the necessary money and support to renovate and rebuild properties, making homes in the area better than before [1]. This resulted in a surge of housing prices, affordable to only the wealthy upper class - which was dominated by the White race [1]. Thus, post-Hurricane Staten Island saw an increase in White race predominance [1], and a decreased prevalence of other races in the area.

		Entering the keywords “New York building” into Google presents autofill results such as “too tall” or “too high” or “20 floors,” the latter being a cheeky reference to the court order “beheading” 20 floors off of a 668 foot building that violated zoning laws in the Upper West Side. Described by the Guardian as “etoliated beanpoles” or essentially, piled up capital, lawmakers have only just managed to halt plans to build a skyscraper in the Lower East Side.  The project, which would have added three 1000 foot apartment towers with supposedly affordable units in a neighbourhood full of low-rise walk-ups. This temporary win against the gentrifying hand likely won’t delay them for long. Technology is a major contributor for NYC’s vertical burgeoning: better concrete, “state of the art” computer software, and fast elevators all call for taller, skinnier buildings. Opposers of these developments are adamant that projects like these wash out lower income residents like a wealthy tide. It’s worth observing these changes as they occur throughout the years as extreme high rise buildings continue to pop up around the city. Of the 10 residential buildings in New York City that are over 800 feet tall, 6 were completed within the last year. New York’s vertical architecture isn’t limited to the present day, however; out of the 10 tallest buildings in Manhattan, only two were built after 2007. We thought New York’s history with infrastructure was worth visualizing, especially in conjunction with variations in population distributions over time.
